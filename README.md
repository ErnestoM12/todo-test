I chose React to develop this system because I feel more comfortable with it, besides it has a very large community of programmers so it has grown a lot, it has many ways of communication between components, like HOC(high Order Componente), Hyperative comunication and props of course.

It has state containers like Redux for faster development in scalable applications like using the dynamic.

used JSX into javascript for browser understanding

well, I think than has a lot of good things.
